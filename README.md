# mvp: blockchain explorer

## Summary ##
This web application was created as an exercise in MVP philosophy. It accesses the Bitcoin blockchain via the BlockCypher API and presents account transaction information to the user based on a public key query. Blockchains can be nebulous objects for many people and this helps make transaction information more accessible.
